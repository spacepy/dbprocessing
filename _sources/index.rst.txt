``dbprocessing`` automates the routine data processing needs arising
in every Heliophysics mission. This Python-based, database-driven
process controller uses the arrival of new data to automatically
execute relevant processing codes, providing updated files for all
possible data products.

Although originally written for Heliophysics data, it is intended to
be flexible enough to manage most forms of digital time-dependent
data.
