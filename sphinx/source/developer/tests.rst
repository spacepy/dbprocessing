Tests

There are two types of testing done with this project. Unit tests, which test if the individual pieces work, and functional tests, which test if the pieces work together

.. _unit:


Unit Tests
==========
Unit Tests are located in the tests/ directory.

To check test coverage (i.e., how many lines of code are actually hit by the tests)::

    python-coverage run test_all.py
    python-coverage html
    firefox htmlcov/index.html

Of course, instead of ``test_all.py``, you can specify the name of the module you want to test.

.. _functional:

Functional Tests
================
Located in test_DB/ is a functional test. The goal was to have the simplest test of dbprocessing so testing is quick and complete without having to use real data.

Level 0 files are just simple words stored in testDB_{set}_(first|sec).raw format.

Level 1 files are the concatenated versions of level 0, stored in testDB_{set}.cat format.

Level 2 files are rot13â€™d versions of the level 1 files, and are stored in testDB_{set}.rot format.

``testDB/scripts/runThisThing.sh`` will execute the needed scripts to run the entire dbprocessing chain.
