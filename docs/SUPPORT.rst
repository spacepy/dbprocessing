Getting help
============

Primary support is via Q&A discussions in the dbprocessing GitHub
repository at
<https://github.com/spacepy/dbprocessing/discussions/categories/q-a>.

It is recommended to search all discussions as well at the issues at
<https://github.com/spacepy/dbprocessing/issues>; your question may
have already been answered by someone else.

Full documentation is at <https://spacepy.github.io/dbprocessing>.

Structured bug reports or enhancement requests can be submitted at
<https://github.com/spacepy/dbprocessing/issues>. This is recommended
if you have a concretely defined bug with good instructions for
reproducing, or well-scoped enhancement. Otherwise opening a
discussion is recommended, at
<https://github.com/spacepy/dbprocessing/discussions>. The
dbprocessing team can work with you to refine the issue.
