This directory contains examples of how to set up dbprocessing for a
project, including configuration and scripts that are specific to
missions. Some examples may be out-of-date for current dbprocessing.

This directory contains miscellaneous bits for sharing between developers.
It is included in the source tarball but not in binary distributions.

scripts:
    Scripts used to interface between dbprocessing and other parts of
    a mission's processing, or to perform specific tasks. As these are
    made more general and/or fully tested, they may be moved to the
    main scripts directory.
