## PR Checklist
New code is easier to review, integrate and maintain if it's
consistent with the style of the rest of the dbprocessing code.
Please try to follow as much of this checklist as you can for
your PR. If a given item is not relevant to your PR, please check
it off, add "(N/A)" to the start of the line, and include a
description below the checklist.

If you don't know how to complete something in the checklist, go
ahead and submit the PR as a draft and ask for help.

Some additional suggestions are given below.

Please also see our Code of Conduct so that the dbprocessing community
remains welcoming and inclusive.

Go ahead and replace the text above (and this line!) with your
pull request description.

- [ ] Pull request has descriptive title
- [ ] Pull request gives overview of changes
- [ ] New code has inline comments where necessary
- [ ] Any new modules, functions or classes have docstrings consistent with dbprocessing style
- [ ] Major new functionality has appropriate Sphinx documentation
- [ ] Added an entry to release notes if fixing a major bug or providing a major new feature
- [ ] New features and bug fixes should have unit tests
- [ ] Relevant issues are linked in the description (use `Closes #` if this PR closes the issue, or some other reference, such as `See #` if it is related in some other way)

<!--
Thank you so much for your PR!  The dbprocessing community appreciates your
help and feedback.  To help us review your contribution, please
consider the following points:

- Do not create the PR out of master, but out of a separate branch.

- The PR title will be included directly in the release notes. It should
  summarize the changes, for example "Fix buildChildren when input files
  span days". Avoid non-descriptive titles such as "Bug fix" or "Updates".

- The PR summary should provide at least 1-2 sentences describing the pull request
  in detail (Why is this change required?  What problem does it solve?) and
  link to any relevant issues. If the PR resolves an issue, please write this in the summary
  so that github will automatically close the issue. E.g. "This PR resolves #1".

We understand that working with PRs can be tricky, even for seasoned contributors.
Please let us know if reviews are unclear or our recommendations seem like excessive work.
If you would like help in addressing a reviewer's comments, or if your PR hasn't been
reviewed in a reasonable timeframe please just comment again.
